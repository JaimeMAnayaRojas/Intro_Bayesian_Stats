  From the Reznick et al., 2012 paper, test the overall (not for every population as in the paper) effects of density on guppies across body sizes.  
  
  # 1. What is the probability that the Growth rate of a guppy <12mm is fater  at 0.5x density is higher than at a 1.0x and 2x fish density?
  # 1. What is the probability that the Growth rate of a guppy >22mm is fater  at 0.5x density is higher than at a 1.0x and 2x fish density?
  # plot the mean probaility of growth  rate for each size class and treatment as in the paper, including the 95%HPDI.
